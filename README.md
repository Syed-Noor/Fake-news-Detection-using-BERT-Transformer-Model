This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook `Fake news File.ipynb`, which is a comprehensive tool for implementing and evaluating methodologies for fake news detection. The project leverages advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques and deep learning models to identify and classify fake news effectively.

## Key Features

### 1. **Text Preprocessing**
- **Techniques**: Cleaning, stop-word removal, lowercasing, and lemmatization.
- Prepares textual data for feature extraction and modeling.

### 2. **Feature Extraction**
- **Methods**:
  - TF-IDF
  - Word2Vec
  - GloVe
  - BERT embeddings
- Ensures robust representation of textual data for deep learning models.

### 3. **Modeling**
- **Approach**: Hybrid methodology combining:
  - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
  - Transformer-based models (e.g., BERT) for contextual analysis.
- Fine-tuning BERT on the dataset to enhance performance.

### 4. **Evaluation**
- **Metrics**:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - F1-score
- **Visualizations**:
  - Confusion matrices
  - Training and validation loss curves

### 5. **Dataset Integration**
- Utilizes a labeled dataset of Pakistani news articles with 11,990 samples:
  - **Real News**: 10,053 samples
  - **Fake News**: 1,937 samples
- Collected from reputable sources like Google Fact Checker, PolitiFact, TheNewsAPI, FactCheck.org, Kaggle, and AFP FactCheck.
